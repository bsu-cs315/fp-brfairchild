# Final Project

# Iteration 1:

This iteration I focused alot of making the bullet pool system working. It has a fully function bullet pool system that will hold bullets that can then be accessed by the enemies and they player, I currently have them seperated so that the players bullets are in a different pool to not mess up the bullet logic. But the enemy pool can be accessed by each of the enemies and are used and recycled to improve performance. This iteration I had alot of stress about creating the pool system, my biggest issue was making it accessable to everyone in the scene, I was able to find the solution to it last night (Nov. 4th) so now this will allow me to grow out the gameplay loop.
