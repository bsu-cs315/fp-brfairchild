# Iteration 1:

This iteration I focused alot of making the bullet pool system working. It has a fully function bullet pool system that will hold bullets that can then be accessed by the enemies and they player, I currently have them seperated so that the players bullets are in a different pool to not mess up the bullet logic. But the enemy pool can be accessed by each of the enemies and are used and recycled to improve performance. This iteration I had alot of stress about creating the pool system, my biggest issue was making it accessable to everyone in the scene, I was able to find the solution to it last night (Nov. 4th) so now this will allow me to grow out the gameplay loop.

# Iteration 2:

This iteration was focused on fixing parts of iteration 1 along with adding some new types of enemies and a timer system to make the levels play out through phases. What still needs to be done is to implement the boss for the stage. One of the issues I have encountered is how to correct the background, currently on my system (EndeavourOS with GNOME) the background is transparent with no real ways to fix this. When I boot into windows it does not sure so I am unsure as to what the issue could be. What I had the most fun with this time was making the title screen look good as well as making a different type of bullet. I am expecting a C on this assessment.

# Iteration 3 Final:

Oh boy this is it, I have had alot of fun with this project, it has turned into multiple different ways to handle a pooling system in godot, I tried 3 different methods, all of which I have noticed have drawbacks and gains. The most challenging part I have faced this time was the bugs that came with trying different pooling systems and how sometimes they did not like to interact with eachother.
